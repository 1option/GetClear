# GetClear

MatLab Application

## Description

This project includes the theory of wavelets and deep learning networks to create a software product in the
`MATLAB` environment. To achieve the goal, the following actions were carried out: the study of the theoretical part of
the characteristics of the river signal, the analysis of the characteristics of the image, the identification of
patterns and algorithms for several types of wavelet transforms (Haar, Daubechies, etc.), the study of two types of
neural networks (Fully connected layers and Convolutional); the software part of the project is also presented - a
graphic application `GetClear`.
